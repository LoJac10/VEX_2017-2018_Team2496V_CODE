With our new 8 motor drive train, it became immediately obvious that our old proportional + min speed system for gyro based turns 
(shown on section ) is no longer effective. We will use a full PID control loop to accomplish these turns. The code for this loop
is shown and commented below:

There are four primary factors that we need to adjust. 
  1. Proportional Constant kP
  2. Integral Constant kI
  3. Derrivative Constant kD
  4. Max integral range max_integ 
 
 The process of adjusting these constants is documented below:
