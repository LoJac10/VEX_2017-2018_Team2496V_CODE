With our new 8 motor drive train, it became immediately obvious that our old proportional + min speed system for gyro based turns 
(shown on section ) is no longer effective. We will use a full PID control loop to accomplish these turns. The code for this loop
is shown and commented below:

There are four primary factors that we need to adjust. 
  1. Proportional Constant kP
  2. Integral Constant kI
  3. Derrivative Constant kD
  4. Max integral range max_integ 
 
 The process of adjusting these constants was far too long (having gone through HUNDREDS of iterations) too completely recall for 
 documentation. However, the relevant proccess and our strategy for constant tuning is explained below.

//used 45, 90, 180
//tested on multiple battries
//all 4 effect each other
//integral totally different based on the max range because
